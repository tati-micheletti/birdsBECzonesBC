This is a translator module that crops and reprojects the data from the [Landcover Classification 2005 data set](ftp://ftp.ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca/ad/NLCCLandCover/LandcoverCanada2005_250m/LandCoverOfCanada2005_V1_4.zip) and the 1000m age map data set from Pan et al. 2012. They are both returned in the projection of the LCC2005 data set.
