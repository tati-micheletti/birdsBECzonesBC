This is a dummy fire module that spreads fires in a raster landscape.
It takes a vegetation map, with the BEACONS 11 classifications, 7 of which are primarily used for forests.
Contact Steve Cumming (Steve Cumming <stevec@sbf.ulaval.ca>) to get latest version of the documentation for this. It is primarily a show piece for the spread function within `SpaDES`.

The fires respond to the vegetation layer, with a simple, expert opinion of flammability by type.
The mapping of vegetation layers to flammability is through different `spreadProb` values for each vegetation type.

## Plotting

The module plots 2 plots: a cumulative fire map, and a dynamic histogram of fire size distribution through the course of a spades simulation.

## Saving

There is no default saving.
